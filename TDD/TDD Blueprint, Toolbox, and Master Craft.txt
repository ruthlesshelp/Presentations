Test Driven Development: Blueprint, Toolbox, and Master Craft

Many say that the practice of test driven development (TDD) has the ability to transform software engineering. Let’s break it down from a skeptical pragmatist’s viewpoint. This presentation focuses on three key ideas; the blueprint, the toolbox, and the master craft. Let’s look at TDD as a blueprint for writing code and discuss the implications and benefit. Let’s go beyond the theoretical application of TDD and focus on the toolbox, with examples of what developers need to know to get going. Finally, TDD is a master craft of Agile engineering. To be effective with TDD, let’s look at the progression of skills needed to achieve the promised results of TDD and to maximize its value.
